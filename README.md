## About

- Given appropriate clinical parameters of a patient, the machine learning model predicts whether or not the patient has heart disease with over &asymp; 90% accuracy.
- The dataset was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) and was trained with different machine learning models and hyper parameters.
- The model was evaluated with accuracy score, optimum results were obtained with logistic regression estimator.
